      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m creating an Ionic 2 and Ionic Native code sample for using Local Notifications and thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a moment to write up a post about notification sounds.
Lets take a look at the typical code to create a Local Notification in Ionic 1:
 In the object being passed to the schedule method you see a sound property. This property is set to the default sound represented by &#39;res://platform_default&#39; which, of course, is the sound that the user has selected as their notification sound.</description>

      <description>An Unnamed Project Last month my friends at Skyward Interactive requested my assistance with a project that needed a cross-platform mobile solution. The project, which will remain unnamed because the client is a start-up, is a prototype for a service and required phone, tablet and server development. The phone apps is for customers, the tablet app is for administrators and the server ties them all together.
For mobile development Skyward typically builds native iOS applications, but most of their iOS resources were tied up with other projects and since this project had a short deadline and budget they asked me if I could assemble the iOS and Android phone solution.</description>
