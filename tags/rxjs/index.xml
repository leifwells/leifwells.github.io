      <description>This week I attended ng-conf for the first time. Last year I tried to get tickets in the lottery but ended up watching online with most everyone else. Of course, I rewatched several of the sessions several times trying to drain every drop of knowledge from these presenters.
This year I took up egghead.io on their &amp;ldquo;buy a workshop ticket and you can buy a conference ticket instead of trying to get a lottery ticket&amp;rdquo; offer.</description>

      <title>Why EverythingIsInBeta?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep track of several projects currently in beta using the Twitter hashtag #EverythingIsInBeta. It&amp;rsquo;s more of an information point rather than something actually useful but, hey, it&amp;rsquo;s Twitter. When was Twitter ever useful?
MY BRAIN HURTS! But seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to jump in and learn new technology. It makes it even more difficult when that technology is in beta. It becomes frustratingly dumbfounding when that beta technology is dependent upon other beta technologies.</description>
