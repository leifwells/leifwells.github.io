          <description>

&lt;p&gt;This week I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ng-conf.org/&#34;&gt;ng-conf&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Last year I tried to get tickets in the lottery but ended up watching online with most everyone else. Of course, I rewatched several of the sessions several times trying to drain every drop of knowledge from these presenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I took up &lt;a href=&#34;http://egghead.io&#34;&gt;egghead.io&lt;/a&gt; on their &amp;ldquo;buy a workshop ticket and you can buy a conference ticket instead of trying to get a lottery ticket&amp;rdquo; offer. Seriously, that was only way I was going to get a conference ticket. I&amp;rsquo;m not lucky enough to win the ng-conf ticket lottery (or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://events.google.com/io2016/&#34;&gt;Google I/O (soon!)&lt;/a&gt; lottery or the WWDC ticket lottery).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was held in Salt Lake City at the Grand American Hotel, an impressively nice place to hold a conference. If you have the money and want to visit SLC, this is the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-angular-2-workshop&#34;&gt;The Angular 2 Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The egghead.io Angular 2 workshop, lead by a clean-shaven &lt;a href=&#34;https://egghead.io/instructors/john-lindquist&#34;&gt;John Lindquist&lt;/a&gt;, was a good experience. I had two sets of goals when I bought my ticket: either to learn a lot during the workshop, or to spend time before the workshop learning as much as possible about Angular 2 and use the event as a measure of what I&amp;rsquo;d correctly learned. Luckily, I had spent a great deal of time becoming acquainted with the new version beforehand, and felt like I was on the mark with most of the content in the workshop. Good on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;catching-up-with-friends&#34;&gt;Catching Up with Friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bit of luck was that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ng-conf.org/#/speaker/chrisgriffith&#34;&gt;Chris Griffith&lt;/a&gt; offered to share his room with me (Super Thanks, Christopher!). Chris was accepted as a speaker this year speaking on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ng-conf.org/#/sessions/chrisgriffithFD&#34;&gt;Ionic 2&lt;/a&gt; during the conference&amp;rsquo;s Fair Day. While eating dinner with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thack&#34;&gt;Terence Carrol&lt;/a&gt;, he asked us how we first met and how we started working together on various projects. It took me a while to realize that Chris and I first worked together on the 360Flex conference application built with Flex and AIR. That was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got to spend some time with a few folks on the Ionic team. I am looking forward to getting to know them better over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sessions&#34;&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some great sessions on Wednesday and Friday. So great, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to rewatch most of them because all the information was hurting my brain. I think this tweet really tells you about where my head is at now that I am home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Things &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ngconf?src=hash&#34;&gt;#ngconf&lt;/a&gt; has me excited about:&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Angular2?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Angular2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ionic2?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Ionic2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Augury?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Augury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AngularUniversal?src=hash&#34;&gt;#AngularUniversal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing&lt;br&gt;The new new new router&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleCloud?src=hash&#34;&gt;#GoogleCloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This community&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Leif Wells (@leifwells) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leifwells/status/728356856813379584&#34;&gt;May 5, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-much-more-to-say&#34;&gt;So Much More to Say&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming week I&amp;rsquo;ll try to talk about all of these things and more. I had a great time at ng-conf, and now I need to decompress and recover before applying things I learned to projects I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
