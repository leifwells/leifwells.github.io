<p>This week I attended <a href="http://www.ng-conf.org/">ng-conf</a> for the first time. Last year I tried to get tickets in the lottery but ended up watching online with most everyone else. Of course, I rewatched several of the sessions several times trying to drain every drop of knowledge from these presenters.</p>

<p>This year I took up <a href="http://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> on their &ldquo;buy a workshop ticket and you can buy a conference ticket instead of trying to get a lottery ticket&rdquo; offer. Seriously, that was only way I was going to get a conference ticket. I&rsquo;m not lucky enough to win the ng-conf ticket lottery (or the <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/">Google I/O (soon!)</a> lottery or the WWDC ticket lottery).</p>

<p>The conference was held in Salt Lake City at the Grand American Hotel, an impressively nice place to hold a conference. If you have the money and want to visit SLC, this is the place.</p>

<h2 id="the-angular-2-workshop:6a62e1efc70084a5bf4e7bdaa30c0085">The Angular 2 Workshop</h2>

<p>The egghead.io Angular 2 workshop, lead by a clean-shaven <a href="https://egghead.io/instructors/john-lindquist">John Lindquist</a>, was a good experience. I had two sets of goals when I bought my ticket: either to learn a lot during the workshop, or to spend time before the workshop learning as much as possible about Angular 2 and use the event as a measure of what I&rsquo;d correctly learned. Luckily, I had spent a great deal of time becoming acquainted with the new version beforehand, and felt like I was on the mark with most of the content in the workshop. Good on me.</p>

<h2 id="catching-up-with-friends:6a62e1efc70084a5bf4e7bdaa30c0085">Catching Up with Friends</h2>

<p>Another bit of luck was that <a href="https://www.ng-conf.org/#/speaker/chrisgriffith">Chris Griffith</a> offered to share his room with me (Super Thanks, Christopher!). Chris was accepted as a speaker this year speaking on <a href="https://www.ng-conf.org/#/sessions/chrisgriffithFD">Ionic 2</a> during the conference&rsquo;s Fair Day. While eating dinner with <a href="https://twitter.com/thack">Terence Carrol</a>, he asked us how we first met and how we started working together on various projects. It took me a while to realize that Chris and I first worked together on the 360Flex conference application built with Flex and AIR. That was a long time ago.</p>

<p>I also got to spend some time with a few folks on the Ionic team. I am looking forward to getting to know them better over the next year.</p>

<p>There were some great sessions on Wednesday and Friday. So great, honestly, I&rsquo;m going to need to rewatch most of them because all the information was hurting my brain. I think this tweet really tells you about where my head is at now that I am home:</p>

<p>In the upcoming week I&rsquo;ll try to talk about all of these things and more. I had a great time at ng-conf, and now I need to decompress and recover before applying things I learned to projects I have in mind.</p>

For those who haven&rsquo;t heard of it, Electron is a technology that combines Node and Chromium and allows Web developers to build desktop applications using their skills with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Electron was built by Github as a shell for their Atom coding tool.</div>

Both Chris and I build prototypes as part of our daily jobs, so the question makes sense; what happens when you need to use archived data &mdash; data that you need will need to update from time to time &mdash; but you don&rsquo;t have the time to build a server application or use something like Firebase to deliver the content?</div>

Lets take a look at the typical code to create a Local Notification in Ionic 1: In the object being passed to the schedule method you see a sound property. This property is set to the default sound represented by 'res://platform_default' which, of course, is the sound that the user has selected as their notification sound.</div>

      <div class="summary">An Unnamed Project Last month my friends at Skyward Interactive requested my assistance with a project that needed a cross-platform mobile solution. The project, which will remain unnamed because the client is a start-up, is a prototype for a service and required phone, tablet and server development. The phone apps is for customers, the tablet app is for administrators and the server ties them all together. For mobile development Skyward typically builds native iOS applications, but most of their iOS resources were tied up with other projects and since this project had a short deadline and budget they asked me if I could assemble the iOS and Android phone solution.</div>

It&rsquo;s more of an information point rather than something actually useful but, hey, it&rsquo;s Twitter. When was Twitter ever useful? MY BRAIN HURTS! But seriously, it&rsquo;s difficult to jump in and learn new technology. It makes it even more difficult when that technology is in beta. It becomes frustratingly dumbfounding when that beta technology is dependent upon other beta technologies.</div>
