<h2 id="what-is-code-coverage">What is Code Coverage?</h2>

<p>Wikipedia says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">&ldquo;code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs.&rdquo;</a> Essentially, when you run the script for code coverage in your Ionic project, the unit tests in your project are run, and analysis of the code being run is generated into a Web site in which you can drill down into and see where more testing work may be needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1648535/30074946-54a36e50-9241-11e7-9ca8-6263d0353c58.png" alt="" />
<em>Sample of the first page of the code coverage documentation.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-developers">What Does This Mean for Developers?</h2>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s the <strong>worst case scenario</strong>: Your immediate manager drops by your cube and tells you that his high-level manager&rsquo;s manager&rsquo;s manager has decided that all company code needs to have unit tests. You have some testing in your project, but you have no idea if you have covered everything that needs to be tested. <em>How do you prove you have any testing in your project at all?</em></p>

<p>That is where code coverage documentation comes in. You run the command to create the code coverage documentation and you have the proof.</p>

<p>On a more practical level, using code coverage documentation is a great way to receive feedback on how well your testing practice is going, give your project managers an idea of how much work may be required for future testing efforts, and allow the whole team to have confidence in the project&rsquo;s future performance.</p>

<p>Simply put, having code coverage documentation available for your project should be used for more than covering your @$$. Leverage the information for greatest effect for you, your testing practice, and your projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-add-code-coverage">How to Add Code Coverage?</h2>

<p>The latest code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example">Github</a>. The changes can be applied to your project by following these steps:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Instructions:</strong> If you are comfortable adding this feature manually, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example/commit/4209c99ddb8e48b6fc914afc51be7ec34e27ca84">this commit</a> to see what actually changed. Once the changes have been made, run the <code>npm run test-coverage</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the following modules into your project:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save-dev karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter istanbul-instrumenter-loader
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add a new script to your <code>package.json</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;test-coverage&quot;: &quot;karma start ./test-config/karma.conf.js --coverage&quot;,
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Step 3 requires files to be replaced. If you have already altered these files, please look at the commits for this project and review the changes. Do not delete or replace files in your project without making backups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Replace your <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example/master/test-config/karma.conf.js"><code>test-config/karma.conf.js</code></a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example/master/test-config/webpack.test.js"><code>test-config/webpack-test.js</code></a> files in your project with those from this project.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Run the <code>npm run test-coverage</code> command. Your unit tests will be run and the documentation will be generated in a folder named <code>coverage</code> in the root of your project. Just open the <code>index.html</code> file in the folder in a browser and see how well your project is covered.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing by itself isn&rsquo;t the end-all thing your projects need to be successful. It is one of many piece to that puzzle. Having code coverage documentation is helpful for quantifying the level of testing you are performing, and can assisting you in focusing improvement efforts. Add code coverage to your testing practice.</p>

      <div class="summary">So, you have an existing Ionic project and now you want to start unit testing and end-to-end testing it. A great way to configure your existing project for testing is use the ionic-unit-testing-example project on Github. This post will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to add modules and files from that project into your own project so you may begin testing your project.
While the name of the project is ionic-unit-testing-example, the project actually sets up two kinds of testing: unit testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing.</div>

      <div class="summary">I&rsquo;m creating an Ionic 2 and Ionic Native code sample for using Local Notifications and thought I&rsquo;d take a moment to write up a post about notification sounds.
Lets take a look at the typical code to create a Local Notification in Ionic 1:
 In the object being passed to the schedule method you see a sound property. This property is set to the default sound represented by 'res://platform_default' which, of course, is the sound that the user has selected as their notification sound.</div>

The project, which will remain unnamed because the client is a start-up, is a prototype for a service and required phone, tablet and server development. The phone apps is for customers, the tablet app is for administrators and the server ties them all together.
For mobile development Skyward typically builds native iOS applications, but most of their iOS resources were tied up with other projects and since this project had a short deadline and budget they asked me if I could assemble the iOS and Android phone solution.</div>

Yeah, I&rsquo;m doing it as well. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea. Usually, if your app uses online data your users will be required to login.
